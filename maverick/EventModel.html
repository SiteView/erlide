<h2> Creating Events</h2>
<p>J2SSH and SSHD now have an event model.  
When key points in the protocols are reached an event is fired.  
Additionaly all logging statements have now been adapted to use the example listeners.
<br>
To create a J2SSHEvent you must create an instance of J2SSHEvent, 
passing in the source object of the event, a message code from MaverickEventCodes, 
and a boolean indicating whether the event is caused by a successful or unsuccessful piece of code.
<br>
Additional information may be added to an event using its addAttribute method. 
</p>
<pre>
J2SSHEvent evt=new J2SSHEvent(this,J2SSHEventCodes.AUTHENTICATION_METHODS_RECEIVED,true);
evt.addAttribute(J2SSHEventCodes.AUTHENTICATION_METHODS, result.getAuthenticationMethods()); 
</pre>

<h2>Managing Events</h2>
<p>There is currently 1 implementation of the EventService called EventServiceImplementation.  
This class is a singleton which manages events. 
MJ2SSHEventListeners can be added and removed from the EventService. 
When a J2SSHEvent has been created it can be fired by passing it to the EventServiceImplementation singletons fireEvent() method, 
which sends the event to each of the registered listeners.
Any attributes must be added to the event before calling fireEvent().
<p>
<pre>
EventServiceImplementation.getInstance().fireEvent(evt);
</pre>

<h2>Event Listeners</h2>
<p>A sample J2SSHEventListener implementation has been provided called J2SSHLoggingListener.  
This inspects every event it receives and retrieves the field name of the message id using J2SSHEventMessages and the events attributes and sends them to log4j.
A more interesting implementation of J2SSHEventListener would check what event type it had be sent and do something useful for certain events.
<p>

<h2>Adding an Event Listener</h2>
<p>The code below demonstrates how to add a listener in Maverick:
</p>

<table border=1>
<tr><td><b>PRODUCT</b></td><td><b>CODE</b></td><td><b>EXAMPLE LOCATION</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>J2SSH 1.3.11+	</td>	<td>SshConnector.addEventListener(new J2SSHLoggingListener());			</td><td>PasswordConnect.java</td></tr>
<tr><td>SSHD 1.3.4+		</td>	<td>ConfigurationContext.addEventListener(new J2SSHLoggingListener());	</td><td>ExampleSSHD.java</td></tr>
<tr><td>SSHD 1.4.0		</td>	<td>DaemonContext.addEventListener(new J2SSHLoggingListener());			</td><td>ExampleSSHD.java</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Future Work</h2>
<p>Future versions of J2SSH and SSHD will convert some of the generic LogEvent calls with named events, 
therefore the constants in J2SSHEventCodes will be added to, 
and any J2SSHEventListener implementations must bear this in mind when designed.
