	<tr><td>SSHDLoggingListener		</td><td>This is an implementation of an event listener which processes events.  This class takes the events it receives and passes messages to log4j</td></tr>

<h2> Creating Events</h2>
<p>J2SSH and SSHD now have an event model.  
When key points in the protocols are reached an event is fired.  
Additionaly all logging statements have now been adapted to use the example listeners.
<br>
To create a SSHDEvent you must create an instance of SSHDEvent, 
passing in the source object of the event, a message code from MaverickEventCodes, 
and a boolean indicating whether the event is caused by a successful or unsuccessful piece of code.
<br>
Additional information may be added to an event using its addAttribute method. 
</p>
<pre>
SSHDEvent evt=new SSHDEvent(this,SSHDEventCodes.AUTHENTICATION_METHODS_RECEIVED,true);
evt.addAttribute(SSHDEventCodes.AUTHENTICATION_METHODS, result.getAuthenticationMethods()); 
</pre>

<h2>Managing Events</h2>
<p>There is currently 1 implementation of the EventService called EventServiceImplementation.  
This class is a singleton which manages events. 
MSSHDEventListeners can be added and removed from the EventService. 
When a SSHDEvent has been created it can be fired by passing it to the EventServiceImplementation singletons fireEvent() method, 
which sends the event to each of the registered listeners.
Any attributes must be added to the event before calling fireEvent().
<p>
<pre>
EventServiceImplementation.getInstance().fireEvent(evt);
</pre>

<h2>Event Listeners</h2>
<p>A sample SSHDEventListener implementation has been provided called SSHDLoggingListener.  
This inspects every event it receives and retrieves the field name of the message id using SSHDEventMessages and the events attributes and sends them to log4j.
A more interesting implementation of SSHDEventListener would check what event type it had be sent and do something useful for certain events.
<p>

<h2>Adding an Event Listener</h2>
<p>The code below demonstrates how to add a listener in Maverick:
</p>

<table border=1>
<tr><td><b>PRODUCT</b></td><td><b>CODE</b></td><td><b>EXAMPLE LOCATION</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>J2SSH 1.3.11+	</td>	<td>SshConnector.addEventListener(new SSHDLoggingListener());			</td><td>PasswordConnect.java</td></tr>
<tr><td>SSHD 1.3.4+		</td>	<td>ConfigurationContext.addEventListener(new SSHDLoggingListener());	</td><td>ExampleSSHD.java</td></tr>
<tr><td>SSHD 1.4.0		</td>	<td>DaemonContext.addEventListener(new SSHDLoggingListener());			</td><td>ExampleSSHD.java</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Future Work</h2>
<p>Future versions of J2SSH and SSHD will convert some of the generic LogEvent calls with named events, 
therefore the constants in SSHDEventCodes will be added to, 
and any SSHDEventListener implementations must bear this in mind when designed.
